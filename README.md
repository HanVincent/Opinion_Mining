# BiLSTM with CRF on Opinion Mining

This repo is my research during internship in National Institute of Informatics, Japan. The topic is to detect opinion mining via deep learning. In this repo, I built bidirectional LSTM model, and BiLSTM with CRF, inspired by the paper - [opinion mining with deep recurrent neural networks](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~oirsoy/drnt.htm). The authors provided C++ code [here](https://github.com/oir/deep-recurrent).
